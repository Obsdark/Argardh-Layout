<h3>1,Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>			(Will be constantly updated)<br/><br/>

Question: What is Argardh?<br/><br/>

Answer: Argardh is a simple-graphic and low-requirement MMORPG and multiplayer PvP-game using Tibia 8.6 engine and plays out in the world of Argardh, a neighbouring realm to the world of Tibia.<br/><br/>

Question: What distinguishes Argardh from other Tibia-based games and OT-servers?<br/><br/>";

echo 'Answer: First of all, Argardh is not using a custom client like some other OT-servers, so basically it is more Tibia than
many "Custom" servers. It is however using a completely new map(along with a huge lore based on Tibias) and there
are many tweaks and small changes that have been made in order to realize the vision of the creators.<br/><br/> 

Question: What are these "Small changes"?<br/><br/>';

echo 'Answer: First off: It is hard to describe what has been the exact aim since not many are really certain of what Tibia 8.6
really is/was.. not many players really know(or care) what exact numbers Tibia 8.6 used for every detail, and to fix the
game back to an "exact" copy of Tibia and then go from there has never been the plan even though it might be comfortable
for the average Tibia player who rarely wants to re-learn anything it was decided that it was not worth the work because well,
either way Argardh is a modification of Tibia so'; echo "don't count on things to be the same. Even though, when it comes to
monsters, items, damage-calculation, skills etc basically everything is the same. The changes made are few and sometimes
small but the consequences will most likely be big. Exactly how"; echo 'these "Rules"/Gameplay-Settings(Better word, right?)
will work out will be interesting to see as even we developers can only'; echo "guess. Here's the changes, in very short:<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>2,Changes in short</h3>


No skullsystem<br/><br/>

Max lvl (100-150)<br/><br/>

Auto-aim enabled and botting allowed(To make it fair for all we will have bots downloadable from our websites). We know
that botting is not a problem in a world without skullsystem and the changes made will promote our 'Vision of Gameplay'.<br/><br/>

All players are reincarnated(spawned after death) inside 'The Worldforge' and can from there chose to teleport
to 7 different temples. Worldforge and most villages have Depot, and all of them have the same container.<br/><br/>

4 New Vocations, and the existing 4 has all been slightly modified. Basically the 4 existing vocations got boosted
in their already strong area while the new vocations cover up the missing branches of possible character-builds.<br/><br/><br/>



<h3>3,Vision of Gameplay</h3>


Argardh is a completely new world, and it is vast. We want to build an entire fantasy-realm as huge as any other and
have already gotten a long way. Our goal was always to create a Roleplaying game with"; echo' an "Open world" map/world
in which you can run around freely and do what you want - without fractions or being bound to specific quests. But
we also did not want to build out the PvP aspect but instead increase its presence and change it. 5v5 and different PvP formats
of tournaments and ladders will take place in Argardh Arena(Located in Siath) but main focus of PvP will be the larger
picture of Guildwars and Battle for control of regions and Castles.<br/><br/>


How our modifications are intended to change the Gameplay:<br/><br/>


Having a max-level gives a boost to casual-players aswell as more power to "the people" instead of the elite powergamers.
This will decentralize power as the advantage of having the highest lvl will be greatly reduced as most or all will be
between 50-100 giving all players a good chance to play a role in Guild-PvP. Training your skills and having the right
equipment is more valuable than previously, however(since the lvl is decreased in importance this is a given result). <br/><br/>

Having no skullsystem basically makes it possible to allow Bots without discrimination. How you want to train, hunt
or make your money(baking bread?) is up to you and Gamemasters will never bother you for Botting. Players will, however,
ofcourse. Without a skullsystem players can easily kill off Unprotected Bots so it is of great importance to make'; echo "sure
you're botting in a Region where you or guildmates can protect the botting character. This is done by grouping/teamplaying with your guild and 
the guilds in the same region. The guilds being able to form the biggest alliances will most likely be the most succesful.<br/><br/><br/>


<h3>4, Vocations:</h3>


Sorcerer: Increased Maxmana /lvl by 10, so now has +40 mana/lvl.<br/>
Druid: Increased Regeneration and Combat Skill-advancement.<br/>
Paladin: Increased skill-advancement in melee-weapons, slightly decreased Shielding-talent<br/>
Knight: +5 Hitpoints /lvl so the Knight now has +20 hitpoints for every new lvl.<br/><br/><br/>


 The 4 new vocations:   (All vocations changes are compared to"; echo' its "original" vocation and not the Argardh-version.)<br/><br/><br/>
						

Citizen: The "No-vocation"-vocation. Increased carry-capacity(10x more/lvl) making it an ideal vocation/character for a
depot-char, trade-botting character or RPG-char.<br/>
Scout(paladin): +15% Damage with Distance Weapons.<br/>
Mystic(sorcerer): The Mix of a Sorcerer and a Druid. Increased mana/lvl(+35/lvl) aswell as regeneration.<br/>
Gladiator(knight): Instead of an increase in Hitpoints like the Knight the Gladiator enjoys a 10% boost in melee-damage,
armor and defense making him an excellent 1v1 warrior.<br/><br/>
	
All 8 vocations have'; echo" 1 'Promotion' that in most but not all cases increases the already lifted talent. <br/><br/>

Exact data and numbers of all vocations, items, monsters etc will always be treated as Open Source at our websites.<br/><br/>

Also, all level and vocation requirements have been taken away on all weapons and consumables. This allows for a lot more
customizable character-builds.<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>5,Guilds</h3>


There are 4 'Main Guilds' that is Run by Gamemasters and is open to everyone, all with a different purpose in order to 
maintain a balanced and fun community, they are:<br/><br/>


Knights of Tibia: Newbie-helpers, Anti-Playerkillers, Protectors of Siath. Area: Siath<br/><br/>

Northern Alliance: Counter-force to KoT. Area: Northern Argardh<br/><br/>

Elders of Argardh: For Roleplayers and Community-active players(We want all established players to have a character
in this guild). Fights to maintain balance within the Realm. Area: Fibula, Stonehome, Westgardhia.<br/><br/>

Dark Brotherhood: Unorganized Guild for Playerkillers and Roleplayers alike. Fights for Zathroth and works for the 
destruction of Argardh. Some quests will be exclusive for this guild - with the max-lvl of 100 we believe and want players
to play multiple characters, roles and alignments. Area: Black Citadel, Hell<br/><br/>


Part from"; echo' this "Community-driven Guilds" are the normal guildsystem where players freely can create and join guilds,
buy guildhalls etc. Most likely some "Main Guilds" will occasionally be used as platforms'; echo" for 'Alliances' and Strategical
Planning and Warfare as they all have their own favoured Region.<br/><br/><br/>




<h3>6: Castles and Region-control</h3>


There are 7 'Regions'. These are sometimes made up of 1-9 guildhalls and several houses
or sometimes just 1 guildhall and a few houses. What 'Region' is most valuable/best to own is not certain as different
guilds and players will be looking for different bonuses. Some Regions have varying hunting-grounds
while some only have high-lvl monsters, some have more Mills and Wheat than others, some have a better geographic placement
than others etc. <br/><br/>

All Regions have a specific Capital Castle where a training statue is respawned every day(With limited hitpoints).<br/><br/>

In every region there is a Drop-off site where resources(mostly food) are spawned every
day. Which Region gets what is up to the Players to find out for themself.<br/><br/>
			
			
Training can/will also be done by Bots/AFK, as every Regional Capital has a Training Statue. These training
spots is tactically easy to protect but Bots/AFKers being left unprotected will most likely be killed by enemies.<br/><br/>


All 7 regions also have one or more Mills(to make bread, which gives a great profit if done 24/7 by a Bot).<br/><br/>


We look"; echo' at "Botting" as "Proof of Work".. basically all Bots can be considered to be NPCs that uphold and give life to 
the gameworld. Cave-boters, Trade-boters and AFK-trainers is all food for playerkillers, and in a larger scale it is of
upmost importance in Guild- and Regional-Wars as many wars end when ones sides resources/money runs out.<br/><br/><br/>				

			
					
<h3>7, Economy</h3>


What ruins most Tibia-servers is bad planning by the developers leading to inflation and a destroyed economy. We want
to change that and believe we have found the magical cure - planned economics. <br/><br/>


Besides the max-lvl(That makes sure your'; echo"character don't lose strength/lvl compared to others if your're inactive)
we will fight the Inflation of goldcoins by:<br/><br/>

1, Decrease the Gold dropped by monsters from 200% down to 100% over the course of 3 years time. This will make sure
that gold earned the first year will not lose as much value when stored/saved compared to a normal Tibia-server. This
gives a great boost to the early players aswell as casual players, and ofcourse mostly those who simply wants to take
a break from Tibia and do something else for a while without losing value of their in-game character, gold and items.<br/><br/>

2, High prices on Potions and other Consumables. This is to make sure that a lot of Goldcoins are being destroyed so that
the existing Goldcoins keep/gain value instead of losing it when people farm more and more gold(The more coins in circulation -
the less value 1 will have). <br/><br/>

3, Investments: You can buy different kind of 'Investments'."; echo'An "Investment" is a piece of paper that NPCs buy and sell.
The value/price will go up and down, so make sure you buy when the Value is low and sell when its High. Investments
are created so that Players can Save the Value of their Money so they see the value Increase along with the Inflation
instead of decrease. <br/><br/><br/>



<h3>8, Houses</h3>


There are hundreds of houses and apartments and 50+ Guildhalls. Houses will in the future(!) pay no Rent, so expect
House-prices to be hugely overgrown compared to normal Tibia-servers. This will make Houses one of the best
investments.<br/><br/><br/>

		
					
<h3>9, Map & Lore</h3>


For maps see www.argardh.com/Maps <br/><br/>


<b>Lore:</b> <br/>
Creation Myth<br/>
The Great War<br/>
Tibia to Argardh<br/>
Races<br/><br/>


				
<h3>10,Server Migration</h3>


Once Argardh is more established(6+ month after December launch) we will allow people to "Migrate" to Argardh just 
like a Server-transfer. But the price will be expensive, as not all Items will be transfered and Max-lvl is still 100.<br/><br/>


The Character/Account you want to "Trade in" /Change to a an Argardh-character will be Sold for market-price and the
Money earned will go directly to Buying Argardh Goldcoins on the free-market for the same amount of $$ - making sure that the value
of Argardh characters and goldcoin is increased instead of decreased by these "Migrations".<br/><br/><br/>
					
					
									
<h3>11, Items</h3>

There will be many new items, some new already exist but most will be gradually released upon Events and Tournaments.
All level and vocation requirements have been taken away on all weapons and consumables. This allows for a lot more
customizable character-builds.<br/><br/>
