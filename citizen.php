				The new Vocation 'Citizen' can lawfully bot simple tasks such as fishing, farming and the new money-making feature of 'Trading'.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				 The new Vocation named 'Citizen' is basically the 'No Vocation' option. The Citizens Bonus however is that he gets 10x more carry capacity / lvl. This makes him an ideal vocation for tasks such as fishing, farming and the new feature of 'Trading'. Trading means buying 'Goods' at Point A for 1.0 gold and selling them at point B for 1.05 gold. Making a steady profit but always risking getting robbed and murdered.
